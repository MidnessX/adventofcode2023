# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains possible solutions for all the 50 puzzles in the Advent of Code 2023 challenge.

Solutions are written in Python and brute force is only used in a couple of instances, where it's actually reasonably fast (brute forcing tougher problems with an interpreted language would be too slow anyway).

I've tried to solve every challenge on the day of release, so code could obviously be better.
